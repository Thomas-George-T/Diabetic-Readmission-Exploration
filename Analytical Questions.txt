Certainly! Below are the revised questions along with hints on how to solve them:

(a) Questions solved using functions you define (such as lambda-map functions):
1. Create a function that calculates the BMI (Body Mass Index) for each patient using their height and weight.
   Hint: Use the formula BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)).

2. Define a function that categorizes patients based on their glucose levels as low, normal, or high.
   Hint: Use if-elif-else statements to define the conditions for each category and apply the function using lambda or map.

3. Write a function to calculate the average age of male and female patients separately.
   Hint: Use pandas' groupby function to group the data by gender and then calculate the mean of the 'age' column.

4. Design a function to identify patients with extreme outlier values in the 'num_medications' column.
   Hint: Use numpy's percentile function to calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles, then determine outliers based on those values.

5. Create a function to convert the 'admission_date' column to a datetime format.
   Hint: Use pandas' to_datetime function to convert the 'admission_date' column to a datetime format.

(b) Questions utilizing Pandas and NumPy (revised):
6. Find the median length of stay for diabetic patients.
   Hint: Use pandas' median function on the 'length_of_stay' column.

7. Calculate the percentage of male and female patients in the dataset.
   Hint: Use pandas' value_counts to get the count of each gender and then calculate the percentage.

8. Determine the most common race/ethnicity among diabetic patients.
   Hint: Use pandas' value_counts on the 'race' column and select the entry with the highest count.

9. Create a new column representing the patients' age groups (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, etc.).
   Hint: Use pandas' cut function to create age bins and assign them to each patient.

10. Find the average number of lab procedures for patients who underwent surgery and those who didn't.
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby function to separate patients who had surgery from those who didn't and then calculate the mean.

(c) Questions with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn (revised):
11. Visualize the distribution of age groups using a pie chart.
    Hint: Use pandas' value_counts to get the count of patients in each age group and then use matplotlib to plot the pie chart.

12. Create a bar plot to show the count of patients in each age group.
    Hint: Use pandas' value_counts and matplotlib's bar chart to plot the count of patients in each age group.

13. Visualize the correlation between age and readmission rates using a scatter plot.
    Hint: Use matplotlib's scatter plot to plot 'age' against 'readmission_rate'.

14. Plot a box plot to compare the length of stay for different races.
    Hint: Use seaborn's boxplot to compare 'length_of_stay' for different values in the 'race' column.

15. Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the number of diagnoses per patient.
    Hint: Use matplotlib or seaborn to plot a histogram of the 'num_diagnoses' column.

(d) Questions revealing valuable insights from the dataset:
16. Identify the top 5 hospitals with the highest readmission rates and explore potential reasons for their high rates.
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby to calculate the average readmission rates for each hospital, then sort to get the top 5.

17. Determine if there is a significant difference in the number of medications prescribed between different race/ethnicity groups.
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby and scipy's statistical tests (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to compare medication prescriptions.

18. Analyze the relationship between the number of lab procedures and the length of stay for diabetic patients.
    Hint: Use seaborn's scatter plot or regression plot to visualize the relationship between 'lab_procedures' and 'length_of_stay'.

19. Investigate whether there is a correlation between the number of diagnoses and the number of medications prescribed.
    Hint: Use pandas' corr function to calculate the correlation between 'num_diagnoses' and 'num_medications'.

20. Use regression analysis to predict the length of stay based on age, number of lab procedures, and other relevant factors.
    Hint: Use libraries like scikit-learn to perform regression analysis on relevant columns and predict 'length_of_stay'.

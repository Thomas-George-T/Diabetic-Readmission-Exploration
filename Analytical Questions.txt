8. Determine the most common race/ethnicity among diabetic patients using the 'race' column.
   Hint: Use pandas' value_counts on the 'race' column and select the entry with the highest count.

9. Create a new column representing the patients' age groups (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, etc.) using the 'age' column.
   Hint: Use pandas' cut function to create age bins and assign them to each patient.

10. Find the average number of lab procedures for patients who underwent surgery and those who didn't, using the 'num_lab_procedures' and 'num_procedures' columns.
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby function to separate patients who had surgery (num_procedures > 0) from those who didn't (num_procedures = 0), then calculate the mean of 'num_lab_procedures' for each group.

(c) Questions with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn (revised):
11. Visualize the distribution of age groups using a pie chart, based on the 'age' column.
    Hint: Use pandas' value_counts to get the count of patients in each age group and then use matplotlib to plot the pie chart.

12. Create a bar plot to show the count of patients in each age group, using the 'age' column.
    Hint: Use pandas' value_counts and matplotlib's bar chart to plot the count of patients in each age group.

13. Visualize the correlation between age and readmission rates using a scatter plot, using the 'age' and 'readmitted' columns.
    Hint: Use matplotlib's scatter plot to plot 'age' against 'readmitted'.

14. Plot a box plot to compare the length of stay for different races, using the 'race' and 'time_in_hospital' columns.
    Hint: Use seaborn's boxplot to compare 'time_in_hospital' for different values in the 'race' column.

15. Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the number of diagnoses per patient, using the 'number_diagnoses' column.
    Hint: Use matplotlib or seaborn to plot a histogram of the 'number_diagnoses' column.

(d) Questions revealing valuable insights from the dataset:
16. Identify the top 5 hospitals with the highest readmission rates and explore potential reasons for their high rates, using the 'readmitted' column.
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby to calculate the average readmission rates for each hospital, then sort to get the top 5.

17. Determine if there is a significant difference in the number of medications prescribed between different race/ethnicity groups, using the medication columns (e.g., 'metformin', 'repaglinide', etc.).
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby and scipy's statistical tests (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to compare medication prescriptions among different race/ethnicity groups.

18. Analyze the relationship between the number of lab procedures and the length of stay for diabetic patients, using the 'num_lab_procedures' and 'time_in_hospital' columns.
    Hint: Use seaborn's scatter plot or regression plot to visualize the relationship between 'num_lab_procedures' and 'time_in_hospital'.

19. Investigate whether there is a correlation between the number of diagnoses and the number of medications prescribed, using the 'number_diagnoses' and 'num_medications' columns.
    Hint: Use pandas' corr function to calculate the correlation between 'number_diagnoses' and 'num_medications'.

20. Use regression analysis to predict the length of stay based on age, number of lab procedures, and other relevant factors, using appropriate columns.
    Hint: Use libraries like scikit-learn to perform regression analysis on relevant columns and predict 'time_in_hospital'.

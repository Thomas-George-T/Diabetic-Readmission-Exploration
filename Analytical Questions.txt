(a) Questions solved using functions you define (such as lambda-map functions):
1. Create a function that categorizes patients based on their glucose levels as low, normal, or high, using the 'max_glu_serum' column.
   Hint: Use if-elif-else statements in the function to define the conditions for each category and apply the function using lambda or map.

(d) Questions revealing valuable insights from the dataset:

17. Determine if there is a significant difference in the number of medications prescribed between different race/ethnicity groups, using the medication columns (e.g., 'metformin', 'repaglinide', etc.).
    Hint: Use pandas' groupby and scipy's statistical tests (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to compare medication prescriptions among different race/ethnicity groups.

19. Investigate whether there is a correlation between the number of diagnoses and the number of medications prescribed, using the 'number_diagnoses' and 'num_medications' columns.
    Hint: Use pandas' corr function to calculate the correlation between 'number_diagnoses' and 'num_medications'.
